    <p>The main school that I would love to attend would be Texas A&M that is my dream school.
        In my mind those choices are the best for college that anyone could ever have.I attended South Loop Elementary for grammar school.Now I am happily enrolled in Kenwood Academy.Being able to be apart of the bronco atmosphere really opened my eyes up.This made me get involved more with school and the activities that took place.Kenwood is steering me down the path to success.</p>
