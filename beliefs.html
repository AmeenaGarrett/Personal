        <h1>What does "Teamwork" mean to me?</h1>

Teamwork means that people will try to cooperate, using their individual skills and providing constructive feedback, despite any personal conflict between individuals.
The combined action of a group of people, especially when effective and efficient.I am a christian.I believe that anything can happen with the help of god.I shall worship noone but god.</p>

        <h1>What does "Leadership" mean to me?</h1>
    
        
        <p>A "leader" is someone who brings people together and guides them toward a common goal. Anyone can tell others what to do, but effective leadership requires much more than the ability to assign tasks to a group.To me Leadership means to be able to step up and make sure everyone is on task and being the one who is willing to take the heat and hold the weight of the team.</p>
